## Think out of the bricks! 🤪

### About Me
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and Computer Vision.
-     However, now I'm focusing on dynamic graph representation learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently an Eng.D. student at Fudan University
- 💞️ I’m advised by Professor [Yun Xiong](https://datascience.fudan.edu.cn/e1/61/c13398a123233/page.htm)
